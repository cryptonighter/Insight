# Stitch Components (v2)

This directory is the home for the new "Stitch" design system components.

## Structure
- Place new atomic components (Buttons, Inputs, Cards) here.
- Complex views can be composed of these atomic components.

## Integration
Connecting these components to the app logic is easy:
1. Import the logic hook (e.g., `useVoiceReflection`).
2. Pass the state/handlers from the hook into your Stitch UI props.
